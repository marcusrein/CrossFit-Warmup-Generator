		    <hr>
		    <p>Dr. Marcus Rein began his journey into the world of movement science when he played international soccer for the US Soccer Federation as well as collegiate soccer at Wake Forest University and the University of Central Florida. In these highly competitive environments, he was introduced to olympic lifting, strength training, exercise programming, and the relationship between high-quality movement and sports performance. After his soccer career ended due to multiple orthopedic injuries, he started a business based on training athletes using a blend of prehabilitation and sports performance. Driven by the desire to provide care that fully encompasses both sports performance and advanced rehabilitation progressions, he left his business to pursue a Doctorate in Physical Therapy from Samuel Merritt University. After graduating in 2016, he continued his pursuit of understanding movement science by regularly coaching CrossFit (CF-L2) as well as receiving specialized training in dry needling (FDN1), various manual therapy treatments, Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation, Kinesiotaping, male pelvic floor rehabilitation, and concussion rehabilitation.

            </p>
            <p>Dr. Rein is proud to have used his skillset to improve the lives of professional athletes, collegiate teams, youth teams, military athletes, barbell athletes, weekend athletes, and potential athletes alike.</p>

            <p>When not working, Dr. Rein can be found coaching soccer, making music, and relaxing with his wife Hannah Grace and their two dogs Berkeley and George..</p>
