			<h2>Dr. Marcus Rein PT DPT CF-L2 </h2>
			<h4>Lead Software Designer of The CrossFit Warmup Generator, Physical Therapist, and CrossFit Coach</h4>
			<hr>
			<p>Dr. Marcus Rein began his journey into the world of movement science when he played international soccer for the US Soccer Federation as well as collegiate soccer at Wake Forest University and the University of Central Florida. In these highly competitive environments, he was introduced to olympic lifting, strength training, exercise programming, and the relationship between high-quality movement and sports performance. After his soccer career ended due to multiple orthopedic injuries, he started a business based on training athletes using a blend of prehabilitation and sports performance. Driven by the desire to provide care that fully encompasses both sports performance and advanced rehabilitation progressions, he left his business to pursue a Doctorate in Physical Therapy from Samuel Merritt University. After graduating in 2016, he continued his pursuit of understanding movement science by regularly coaching CrossFit (CF-L2) as well as receiving specialized training in dry needling, various manual therapy techniques, Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation, Kinesiotaping, and concussion rehabilitation.

			<p>Dr. Rein has now expanded his skillset to include software design. Through self-taught methods and guidance from his brother and a few helpful friends along the way, he is proud to bring you The CrossFit Warmup Generator.
